1
00:00:02,135 --> 00:00:03,636
[Wade] You do realize this camp
was closed down,

2
00:00:03,736 --> 00:00:04,904
like, twenty years ago?

3
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:06,405
But I'm pretty sure
the way the story goes,

4
00:00:06,505 --> 00:00:09,375
some woman, she went nuts.
Killed all these counselors.

5
00:00:09,475 --> 00:00:11,444
Blamed them
for her son's drowning.

6
00:00:13,245 --> 00:00:15,181
The place was called
Camp Crystal Lake.

7
00:00:17,317 --> 00:00:18,418
Jason...

8
00:00:23,656 --> 00:00:25,891
...he came back.

9
00:00:25,991 --> 00:00:29,128
My sister, she came camping up
around here with some friends.

10
00:00:29,228 --> 00:00:30,396
She's gone missing.

11
00:00:30,496 --> 00:00:31,197
[Gasps]

12
00:00:31,297 --> 00:00:32,598
She ain't missing. She's dead.

13
00:00:32,698 --> 00:00:35,668
People go missing around here,
they're gone for good.

14
00:00:35,768 --> 00:00:37,504
No! No, no, no!
Argh!

15
00:00:41,507 --> 00:00:44,544
Here it is.
Make yourselves at home.

16
00:00:44,644 --> 00:00:47,447
Mi casa es su casa.

17
00:00:50,583 --> 00:00:51,985
[Bracke] You know
how many thousands of people

18
00:00:52,085 --> 00:00:53,486
disappear every year?

19
00:00:56,121 --> 00:00:57,524
There's no evidence.

20
00:00:59,292 --> 00:01:03,263
No car, no witnesses.

21
00:01:04,497 --> 00:01:07,166
- Alright, you ready?
- Ready. Let's do it.

22
00:01:07,267 --> 00:01:09,169
[Chewie] This is a man's sport.

23
00:01:09,902 --> 00:01:11,237
Nolan!

24
00:01:11,337 --> 00:01:13,306
[Jenna] There's a guy out there
carrying a dead body.

25
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:17,010
[Woman] They bring trouble.
We just wanna be left alone.

26
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:18,511
And so does he.

27
00:01:21,547 --> 00:01:22,515
So does who?

28
00:01:28,154 --> 00:01:29,789
Richie, stop fucking around.

29
00:01:32,091 --> 00:01:34,227
[Screams]
